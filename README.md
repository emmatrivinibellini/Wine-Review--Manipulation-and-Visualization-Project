## üéØ Objectives  

- **Country-Level Insights:** Understand global wine performance by calculating average scores and prices per country.  
- **Italian Market Focus:** Deep dive into Italy‚Äôs regional data to explore price distributions, correlations, and provincial differences.  
- **European Context:** Map wine production across Europe to highlight major producers and grape varieties.  
- **Price‚ÄìQuality Relationship:** Measure correlations to determine whether higher prices truly align with better quality.

## üß† Key Insights  

- **Italy, France, and Spain** dominate European wine production.  
- **Piedmont and Tuscany** lead Italy‚Äôs premium wine market, with consistently high scores.  
- **Tuscany accounts for 30%** of bottles sold nationally, confirming its strong global brand.  
- **Moderate correlation (0.42)** between price and quality ‚Äî price does not guarantee excellence.  
- The **Italian market shows a positively skewed price distribution**, reflecting a mix of affordable and luxury wines.
